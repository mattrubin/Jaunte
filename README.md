## A Launcher for Mac OS X

This project contains a work-in-progress launcher application in the spirit of [Quicksilver](http://www.blacktree.com/), [LaunchBar](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/), or [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/). With so many similar apps out there, the goal of this project is primarily academic, to explore faceless applications, universal keyboard triggers, filesystem indexing, application extensibility, etc.
